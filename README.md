# canvas_announcements
python script to automate posting announcements to my classes

I'm using Jupyter Notebooks and AI.
Started today, Sept 1st 2024.

Using Jupyter, so open terminal: jupyter notebook.

Connecting to Canvas, need API code.
api code kept in separate file and pulled in during initialization.
  File labled credentials.py kept in same folder as python script.

it works! I'll update docs later. :)
